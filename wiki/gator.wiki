#summary Features, installation, and use of Gator log aggregating server application.
#labels Gator,log4j

= Features =
Gator provides the following features/services:
  * Single point of configuration for log4j logging across multiple applications on multiple hosts
  * Aggregated logging from all applications/nodes on the host running Gator
  * Web-based configuration manager
  * Real-time Web-based log viewer

A bit of background may help put the features above in context.  Gator evolved from an amalgam of JBoss and the log4j [http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/apidocs/org/apache/log4j/net/SocketServer.html SocketServer] to address our need for consolidated logging across multiple nodes and tiers of an enterprise Java application.  We chose this solution for a few reasons:
  # Wanted per-node logging and consolidated logging for redundancy
  # The timestamps on the nodes were required to match exactly those on the server
  # We did not have control of syslog configuration on our hosts
Although the application used commons logging internally, we used the log4j engine underneath.  This made us secure in choosing a log4j-specific solution.  Although the end result suited our needs, it was a pain to configure.  Our solution required a JBoss container instance for each instance (development, pre-production, production) of our application, where each JBoss instance had a slightly different configuration.  And there were also 2 log4j configuration files for each server, one for the container and one for the nodes.  This is where it got dicey.  There were some very non-intuitive requirements on appender configuration and log levels of categories that only 1 person in the group understood well enough to troubleshoot.  But it worked once it was up and running, and it performed well.

And then we would need to modify the logger configuration for a node or aspect of the application.  The process was both tedious and error prone, and again, we had to lean on a single person in the group to help troubleshoot configuration errors.  After running into this problem a few times, and getting more insight into the architecture of our solution, I had a hunch we could do better.  And then the outline of Gator emerged from a week or so of hacking on a JDBC-backed log4j configuration engine and a new SocketServer implementation that understood the notion of a project containing both a log4j logger hierarchy and allowed clients.
