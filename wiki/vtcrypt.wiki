= Introduction =
These crypt utilities were created to do basic encryption and decryption.
The current version uses the Bouncy Castle library.
No crypto code is implemented in this library, it is simply a wrapper around the Bouncy Castle implementations.
There is support for all the ciphers which Bouncy Castle supports, however special classes have been created for the more commonly used algorithms.
There are many convenience methods for doing common encryption and decryption tasks, including creating BASE64 and HEX encoded data, as well as, writing data to disk.
