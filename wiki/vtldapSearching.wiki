= Introduction =
This library provides two basic methods for searching an LDAP.
  # Filter based searches <br/> These methods take the form of Ldap.search(...) and always contain a !SearchFilter as an argument. Returned results are entries that match the supplied filter.
  # Attributes based search <br/> These methods take the form of Ldap.searchAttributes(...) and always contain an Attributes as an argument. Returned results are entries that contain matches to the supplied attributes.

= Filter Based Searching =

Search for everyone with a first name of *daniel* and a last name of *fisher*, then return their _mail_ and _displayName_ attributes.
